# Private Events

## TODO: Update this later.

This project involved builing a Rails App where the public can see events.However, only signed in members can see the details of the events and can click on the attend button in order to add it to their list of events. Only signed in users can also create new events.

The user page shows a list of all events the user has chosen to attend. The list is divided into 2, past events and upcoming events.
